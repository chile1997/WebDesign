    <h1>My Hobby: Painting</h1>

    <!-- Section 1: Portrait Painting -->
    <h2>Portrait</h2>

    <!-- Materials and Techniques -->
    <h3>Techniques of Portrait</h3>
    <p>
        I use sfumato and glazing techniques to improve the intensity of the face and emphasize facial features, capturing each individual's essence and emotion. 
        Beside the sfumato method, I usually use brush stroke to  blend different colors to create softness in the skin and clearly define the contours of the face. 
        To add richness to the painting, I use glazing to layer multiple colors to increase the vibrancy of the colors and create a luminous quality that brings the portraits to life.   
    </p>
    <h3>Time</h3>
    <p>
        I often draw portraits when I want to capture the likeness of my family members on major holidays.

    <!-- Section 2: Landscape Painting -->
    <h2>Landscape</h2>

    <!-- Materials and Techniques -->
    <h3>Technique of Landscape</h3>
    <p>
        When painting landscapes, I clearly define light and dark areas to create a harmonious space, depth, and perspective. 
        I usually focus on the natural light and the mood of the scene's atmosphere rather than its details.
    </p>
    <h3>Time</h3>
    <p>
        I often draw landscapes when I have free time, especially on rainy days, because I feel the most emotional.
    </p>


    <!-- Section 3: Still-Life Painting -->
    <h2>Still-Life</h2>

    <!-- Materials and Techniques -->
    <h3>Technique of Still-Life</h3>
    <p>
        In my still-life paintings, I often employ the technique of carefully arranging the shapes of objects to focus on the depiction of texture and the method of chiaroscuro to depict volume and form.
    </p>
    <h3>Time</h3>
    <p>
        I usually spend about one hour a day practicing my technique and learning to describe the material of the object.

    <p>Vincent Van Gogh quote: 
        <q>
            It is better to be high-spirited even though one makes more mistakes, than to be narrow-minded and all too prudent.

        </q>
    </p>
    <p>
        This is an inspirational quote that I keep in mind every time I create art. I don't need to be afraid to try to draw perfectly because only by not being afraid of making mistakes can I create a better-drawing self than yesterday.
